# Brew & Beans â€“ Coffee Shop Website

This project contains a small, production-ready static website for a coffee shop built with Tailwind CSS via CDN. It includes four pages: Home, Menu, About, and Contact, plus a README with usage notes.

How to run:
- No server is required. Open the HTML files directly in a browser, or host on any static site hosting.
- All styling uses Tailwind CSS classes; no external CSS files are included.

Pages:
- index.html: Home with hero, highlights, and intro to the brand.
- menu.html: Coffee and pastries with itemized pricing.
- about.html: Brand story, values, and team.
- contact.html: Location, hours, and a contact form.

Notes:
- All images are placeholders using the template src 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/5877588/pexels-photo-5877588.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940'. Replace them with real URLs as needed.
- Font Awesome is loaded via CDN in the footer of each page for icons.
- Internal links allow navigation between pages.

Accessibility & UX:
- All images have alt text.
- Semantic HTML structure with single h1 per page.
- Mobile-friendly responsive layout via Tailwind utility classes.
